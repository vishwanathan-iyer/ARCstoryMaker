In the royal court of Emperor Akbar, a clever and witty court jester named Birbal was known for his quick wit and cleverness. One day, the emperor summoned Birbal to the palace and ordered him to cook his favorite dish, khichidi, for him. However, the emperor was not satisfied with the usual way of cooking khichidi, and he presented Birbal with a challenge: to cook the khichidi in a way that would make it so delicious that it would make the emperor forget all his worries and troubles.

Birbal thought for a moment and then said that he would cook the khichidi in a way that would make it so delicious that the emperor would forget all his worries and troubles. He started to cook the khichidi, but instead of using the usual ingredients, he added a few secret spices and herbs that he had learned about from his travels. When the khichidi was ready, Birbal presented it to the emperor, who was immediately struck by the aroma and flavor of the dish. The emperor took a bite and was so impressed that he declared Birbal the official royal chef.

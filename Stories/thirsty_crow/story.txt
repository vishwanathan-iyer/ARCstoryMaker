In a dry and barren land, a crow named Kavita searched for a source of water. She had been flying for hours, but every pond and river she saw was either dry or contaminated. As the sun beat down on her feathers, Kavita's throat parched with thirst.

As she flew over a small village, Kavita spotted a group of children playing in a courtyard. They seemed to be splashing water from a large clay pot, and Kavita's eyes grew wide with excitement. She swooped down, hoping to get a drink. But the children, seeing her, began to laugh and chase her away.

Undeterred, Kavita flew to the edge of the courtyard and began to dig in the dirt with her beak. The children, still laughing, watched in amazement as Kavita uncovered a small, hidden well. They gasped as the crow dipped her beak into the cool, clear water and took a long, refreshing drink.

From that day on, Kavita visited the children every day, and they would fill her well with water. The crow's thirst was finally quenched, and she learned that even in the most unlikely places, there can be hidden treasures waiting to be discovered.

It was a dark and stormy night in Mumbai, the kind where the rain lashed down like a thousand knives and the streets seemed to shiver with every sound. ACP Pradyuman, Abhijeet, and Daya were huddled in their office, sipping hot chai and trying to warm themselves up when the phone rang.

It was a case of a wealthy businessman who had been found dead in his mansion, with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small piece of paper on the victim's desk with a cryptic message: 'The truth is in the eyes of the killer'. ACP Pradyuman knew he had to act fast, and he assigned Abhijeet and Daya to investigate the crime scene.

As they dug deeper, they discovered that the victim had been blackmailing several people, including a well-known politician and a powerful businessman. But just as they thought they had cracked the case, they received a call from the killer, who revealed that there was a traitor in their midst. The phone call ended abruptly, and Abhijeet and Daya were left staring at each other in shock.

ACP Pradyuman called an emergency meeting to discuss the case. He reminded his team that in CID, loyalty and trust were just as important as solving the case. He praised Abhijeet and Daya for their hard work, but also warned them to be vigilant and not to trust anyone until the case was solved. The team worked together, and eventually, they caught the killer, revealing the traitor to be none other than Abhijeet's own brother.

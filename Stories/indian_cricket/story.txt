As they began their training, Rohit Sharma, the star batsman, noticed that his usual spot in the lineup was being occupied by a new player, Rishabh Pant. Feeling a bit miffed, Rohit approached Virat Kohli and expressed his concerns. Virat, being the wise and fair leader that he is, explained that Rishabh had been performing exceptionally well in the nets and deserved a chance to play.

Vikram and Betaal are on their way to the next village, but this time they're not alone. They've brought a special guest, a mischievous monkey named Hanuman's cousin, who loves to play tricks on them.  
[FIGURE]  
As they approach the village, they notice that the villagers are frantically searching for something. It's Betaal's favorite snack, the sacred Indian dessert, Jalebi. It's gone missing, and the villagers are in a panic. Vikram and Betaal decide to play along and start searching for the Jalebi, with the monkey causing chaos and laughter wherever they go.

As they search high and low, they finally find the Jalebi hidden in a nearby tree. But, to their surprise, it's not alone. It's been replaced by a giant, talking pickle jar, who claims to be the thief and demands to be taken to the gods. Vikram and Betaal are baffled, but the monkey just laughs and says, 'I knew it all along!'  
[FIGURE]  
In the end, they take the pickle jar to the gods, who are amused by the mischievous monkey's antics. The gods reward the monkey with a never-ending supply of Jalebi, and Vikram and Betaal learn a valuable lesson: even the most absurd situations can lead to laughter and joy. The story ends with the three friends walking off into the sunset, laughing and joking together.
